# Water Point Prediction Project
This repository contains code and resources for the Water Point Prediction project. The goal of this project is to predict the functionality of water points in a given area, based on various geographical, environmental, and socio-economic factors. The predictions can help in prioritizing maintenance and repair efforts, ensuring sustainable access to clean water.

# Features
-> Data preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and integrating datasets.

-> Feature engineering: Extracting relevant features and creating new ones.

-> Exploratory data analysis: Visualizing and understanding the data.

Model development: Training and evaluating machine learning models.

Predictive analysis: Making predictions on new water points.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of information about existing water points, including their location, functionality status, water source type, population served, and other relevant attributes. The dataset is collected from various sources and preprocessed for analysis.

# Usage
-> Open the Jupyter Notebook file Water_Point_Prediction.ipynb.

-> Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, develop and evaluate predictive models.

-> Run the notebook cells to execute the code and generate insights.
# Model Performance
The performance of the predictive models is evaluated based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The models aim to achieve high accuracy in predicting the functionality of water points.

# Future Enhancements
-> Incorporate real-time data for more accurate predictions.

-> Implement advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble methods or deep learning algorithms to improve model performance.

-> Develop a user-friendly interface for easy access and utilization of the predictive models.
