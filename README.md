# Water-_Point_Prediction
Background & Motivation:

Water is the ultimate gift of nature to humanity and every living organism. Most of us have the luxury to lead our daily lives without feeling blunt of water scarcity but there are people in some parts of the world where they would have to walk several miles to have access to water. The situation worsens for them if this access, such as pumps, wells, or other water-points, also shuts down unexpectedly.

If a Machine Learning algorithm can predict which water point may fail in the immediate future, they can divert the maintenance resource towards that point with reasonable advance notice.

ProblemStatement: Your goal is to build an ML model(s) which trains on the given data, is appropriately validated, and finally predicts on the test data provided to you.
